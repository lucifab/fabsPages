            <h2>About</h2>
            <div>
                As a full-stack developer working in the financial technology space—particularly within the sports and
                entertainment industry—
                I've contributed to projects supporting major organizations like the NHL, NFL, Austin FC, EBG,
                Learfield,
                and others through Two Circles and KORE. My work spans modernizing front-end applications,
                architecting backend services, and managing complex data pipelines that support real-time business
                needs.

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="container text">

                <div>
                    I'm driven by a deep curiosity and love for learning—whether it's exploring new programming
                    paradigms,
                    understanding business operations,
                    or diving into the inner workings of an industry. This mindset pushes me to continuously evolve,
                    integrating insights from across
                    disciplines to build smarter, more impactful solutions. I don’t just learn for the sake of
                    knowledge—I
                    apply what I learn to
                    connect the technical with the strategic, ensuring every line of code contributes to a clear
                    business
                    goal. I bring a detail-oriented and thorough approach to development,
                    ensuring that nuanced tasks are thoughtfully handled.

                <div>
                    By combining deep technical expertise with a strong grasp of industry-specific needs, I deliver
                    solutions
                    that not only meet high engineering standards
                    but directly align with client objectives—translating complex business requirements into great
                    products
                    that
                    resonate
                    with the unique demands of the sports and entertainment sector.
